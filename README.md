# About Me
I am a naturally inquisitive software engineer with a passion for elegant design, beautifully written code, and the application of scientific processes to software development. I have a firm understanding of architectural principles, the object-oriented and functional paradigms, I practise test-driven development, and I work hard to design, define, and refine maintainable and scalable code. I hold myself to a strict code of engineering ethics and respect the responsibility of producing quality work. I am a disciplined, frictionless team worker with a growth mindset and desire to collaborate with top-tier engineers and develop great software.
